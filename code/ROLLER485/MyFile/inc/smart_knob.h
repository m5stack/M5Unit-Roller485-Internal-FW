 generally result in an integer position change (unless position is already at a
 limit).

 Arbitrary 50-byte string representing this "config". This can be used to identify major

 other config fields. */

 For a "magnetic" detent mode - where not all positions should have detents - this
 specifies which positions (up to 5) have detents enabled. The knob will feel like it
 is "magnetically" attracted to those positions, and will rotate smoothy past all
 other positions.

 If you want to have more than 5 magnetic detent positions, you will need to dynamically
 update this list as the knob is rotated. A recommended approach is to always send the
 _nearest_ 5 detent positions, and send a new Config message whenever the list of
 positions nearest the current position (as reported via State messages) changes.

 This approach enables effectively unbounded detent positions while keeping Config
 bounded in size, and is resilient against tightly-packed detents with fast rotation
 since multiple detent positions can be sent in advance; a full round-trip Config-State
 isn't needed between each detent in order to keep up. */
